# isle.util.parameters takes arbitrary keyword arguments, constructs a new dataclass,
# and stores the function arguments in an instance of it.
# The object is written to the output file and read back in by all subsequent processes.
# Use this to store all physical and model parameters and make them accessible later.
#
# Note that all objects stored in here must be representable in and constructible
# from YAML. You need to register new handlers if you have custom types.

### Function to construct actions.
# This function has to construct and return all actions to be used in HMC.
# It is saved as source code to the output file and read back in by any
# subsequent process. It can therefore not rely on any external (global) state
# and must define / import everything it needs!
#
# Parameters:
#     lat - An instance of isle.Lattice containing the hopping matrix
#           and number of time steps.
#     params - Dataclass instance of parameters, see above (PARAMS).
