    Tabulate correlator with a creation operator on each site.

    Because particles and holes are fermions, the Wick contractions are totally
    antisymmetric, which makes it particularly easy to compute.

    If P[xf,tf,xi,ti] is an all-to-all particle propagator, then the Wick contractions
    for this very symmetric case can be written as the determinant on the spatial
    indices xf and xi.

    How come?  Consider the correlation function between
        a[n]a[n-1]...a[3]a[2]a[1]               at time t
    and
        adag[1] adag[2] adag[3] ... adag[n]     at time 0
    where the product is over all the sites.

    We must now compute all the Wick contractions.  The first term is obvious,
        + P11 P22 P33 ... Pnn   (suppressing time indices)
    the next obvious one is to contract a[2] with adag[1] and a[1] with adag[2].
    Because this contraction has a crossing, it gets a minus sign.
        - P12 P21 P33 ... Pnn
    How many Wick contractions *are* there?  It's clearly n!
    And, every time there's a crossing, in the contraction we pick up another sign.

    Now compare to this formula for the determinant of A:

    det A = epsilon_{i_1, i_2, i_3, ... i_n} A_{1,i_1} A_{2,i_2} A_{3,i_3} \cdots A_{n,i_n}

    They clearly match!

    So, by taking determinants over the spatial indices we can construct correlators
    for these maximal operators.
