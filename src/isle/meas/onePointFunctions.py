# One-point functions

We can use the bilinear operators with vacuum quantum numbers
described in the SpinSpinCorrelator documentation to compute one-point functions.

All the vacuum quantum number bilinears can be written as combinations of the
number operators,
\f{align}{
    \left\langle n^p_x \right\rangle
          & = \left\langle a_x^\dagger a_x \right\rangle
            = \left\langle 1-a_x a_x^\dagger \right\rangle
            = \left\langle 1-P_{xx} \right\rangle
    \\
    \left\langle n^h_x \right\rangle
          & = \left\langle b_x^\dagger b_x \right\rangle
            = \left\langle 1-b_x b_x^\dagger \right\rangle
            = \left\langle 1-H_{xx} \right\rangle
\f}
For example, the expected charge density operator
\f[
    \rho_x = 1-2S^0_x = n^p_x - n^h_x
\f]
(as we use positive particles), the total number operator
\f[
    n_x = n^p_x + n^h_x
\f]
and the z-component of spin is given by
\f[
    S^3_x = \frac{1}{2} \left( 1 - n_x \right)
\f]

We can transform into a different basis; by default the results are in the spatial basis.
